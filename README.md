# Home Credit: predicting clients' repayment abilities

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories.
Home Credit Group Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. To make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data -including telco (telecommunications provider) and transactional information -to predict their clients' repayment abilities.
While Home Credit is currently using various statistical methods to make these predictions, they're hoping that our ML project will unlock the full potential of their data.
By doing so we will ensure that clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with trust that will empower their clients to be successful.
